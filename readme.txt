Contradiction (feat. Tyler Carter)
If view binding is enabled for a module, a binding class is generated for each XML layout file that the module contains. Each binding class contains references to the root view and all views that have an ID. The name of the binding class is generated by converting the name of the XML file to camel case and adding the word "Binding" to the end.

For example, given a layout file called result_profile.xml:

<LinearLayout ... >
    <TextView android:id="@+id/name" />
    <ImageView android:cropToPadding="true" />
    <Button android:id="@+id/button"
        android:background="@drawable/rounded_button" />
</LinearLayout>

The generated binding class is called ResultProfileBinding. This class has two fields: a TextView called name and a Button called button. The ImageView in the layout has no ID, so there is no reference to it in the binding class.

Every binding class also includes a getRoot() method, providing a direct reference for the root view of the corresponding layout file. In this example, the getRoot() method in the ResultProfileBinding class returns the LinearLayout root view.

The following sections demonstrate the use of generated binding classes in activities and fragments.

Use view binding in activities
To set up an instance of the binding class for use with an activity, perform the following steps in the activity's onCreate() method:

Call the static inflate() method included in the generated binding class. This creates an instance of the binding class for the activity to use.
Get a reference to the root view by either calling the getRoot() method or using Kotlin property syntax.
Pass the root view to setContentView() to make it the active view on the screen.
KOTLIN
JAVA
private ResultProfileBinding binding;

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    binding = ResultProfileBinding.inflate(getLayoutInflater());
    View view = binding.getRoot();
    setContentView(view);
}

You can now use the instance of the binding class to reference any of the views:

KOTLIN
JAVA
binding.getName().setText(viewModel.getName());
binding.button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    viewModel.userClicked()
});

Use view binding in fragments
To set up an instance of the binding class for use with a fragment, perform the following steps in the fragment's onCreateView() method:

Call the static inflate() method included in the generated binding class. This creates an instance of the binding class for the fragment to use.
Get a reference to the root view by either calling the getRoot() method or using Kotlin property syntax.
Return the root view from the onCreateView() method to make it the active view on the screen.
Note: The inflate() method requires you to pass in a layout inflater. If the layout has already been inflated, you can instead call the binding class's static bind() method. To learn more, see an example from the view binding GitHub sample.
KOTLIN
JAVA
private ResultProfileBinding binding;

@Override
public View onCreateView (LayoutInflater inflater, 
                          ViewGroup container,

    binding = ResultProfileBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false);
    View view = binding.getRoot();
    return view;
}

@Override
public void onDestroyView() {
    super.onDestroyView();
    binding = null;

You can now use the instance of the binding class to reference any of the views:

Use view binding in fragments
To set up an instance of the binding class for use with a fragment, perform the following steps in the fragment's onCreateView() method:

Call the static inflate() method included in the generated binding class. This creates an instance of the binding class for the fragment to use.
Get a reference to the root view by either calling the getRoot() method or using Kotlin property syntax.
Return the root view from the onCreateView() method to make it the active view on the screen.
Note: The inflate() method requires you to pass in a layout inflater. If the layout has already been inflated, you can instead call the binding class's static bind() method. To learn more, see an example from the view binding GitHub sample.
KOTLIN
JAVA
private ResultProfileBinding binding;

@Override
public View onCreateView (LayoutInflater inflater, 
                          ViewGroup container, 
                          Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    binding = ResultProfileBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false);
    View view = binding.getRoot();
    return view;
}

@Override
public void onDestroyView() {
    super.onDestroyView();
    binding = null;
}

You can now use the instance of the binding class to reference any of the views:

KOTLIN
JAVA
binding.getName().setText(viewModel.getName());
binding.button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    viewModel.userClicked()
});

Note: Fragments outlive their views. Make sure you clean up any references 
If view binding is enabled for a module, a binding class is generated for each XML layout file that the module contains. Each binding class contains references to the root view and all views that have an ID. The name of the binding class is generated by converting the name of the XML file to camel case and adding the word "Binding" to the end.

For example, given a layout file called result_profile.xml:

<LinearLayout ... >
    <TextView android:id="@+id/name" />
    <ImageView android:cropToPadding="true" />
    <Button android:id="@+id/button"
        android:background="@drawable/rounded_button" />
</LinearLayout>

The generated binding class is called ResultProfileBinding. This class has two fields: a TextView called name and a Button called button. The ImageView in the layout has no ID, so there is no reference to it in the binding class.

Every binding class also includes a getRoot() method, providing a direct reference for the root view of the corresponding layout file. In this example, the getRoot() method in the ResultProfileBinding class returns the LinearLayout root view.

The name of the binding class is generated by converting the name of the XML file to camel case and adding the word "Binding" to the end.

For example, given a layout file called result_profile.xml:

<LinearLayout ... >
    <TextView android:id="@+id/name" />
    <ImageView android:cropToPadding="true" />
    <Button android:id="@+id/button"
        android:background="@drawable/rounded_button" />
</LinearLayout>

The generated binding class is called ResultProfileBinding. This class has two fields: a TextView called name and a Button called button. The ImageView in the layout has no ID, so there is no reference to it in the binding class.

Every binding class also includes a getRoot() method, providing a direct reference for the root view of the corresponding layout file. In this example, the getRoot() method in the ResultProfileBinding class returns the LinearLayout root view.

The following sections demonstrate the use of generated binding classes in activities and fragments.

Use view binding in activities
To set up an instance of the binding class for use with an activity, perform the following steps in the activity's onCreate() method:

Call the static inflate() method included in the generated binding class. This creates an instance of the binding class for the activity to use.
Get a reference to the root view by either calling the getRoot() method or using Kotlin property syntax.
Pass the root view to setContentView() to make it the active view on the screen.
KOTLIN
JAVA
private ResultProfileBinding binding;

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    binding = ResultProfileBinding.inflate(getLayoutInflater());
    View view = binding.getRoot();
    setContentView(view);
}

You can now use the instance of the binding class to reference any of the views:

KOTLIN
JAVA
binding.getName().setText(viewModel.getName());
binding.button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    viewModel.userClicked()
});

Use view binding in fragments
To set up an instance of the binding class for use with a fragment, perform the following steps in the fragment's onCreateView() method:

Call the static inflate() method included in the generated binding class. This creates an instance of the binding class for the fragment to use.
Get a reference to the root view by either calling the getRoot() method or using Kotlin property syntax.
Return the root view from the onCreateView() method to make it the active view on the screen.
Note: The inflate() method requires you to pass in a layout inflater. If the layout has already been inflated, you can instead call the binding class's static bind() method. To learn more, see an example from the view binding GitHub sample.
KOTLIN
JAVA
private ResultProfileBinding binding;

@Override
public View onCreateView (LayoutInflater inflater, 
                          ViewGroup container,

    binding = ResultProfileBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false);
    View view = binding.getRoot();
    return view;
}

@Override
public void onDestroyView() {
    super.onDestroyView();
    binding = null;

You can now use the instance of the binding class to reference any of the views:

Use view binding in fragments
To set up an instance of the binding class for use with a fragment, perform the following steps in the fragment's onCreateView() method:

Call the static inflate() method included in the generated binding class. This creates an instance of the binding class for the fragment to use.
Get a reference to the root view by either calling the getRoot() method or using Kotlin property syntax.
Return the root view from the onCreateView() method to make it the active view on the screen.
Note: The inflate() method requires you to pass in a layout inflater. If the layout has already been inflated, you can instead call the binding class's static bind() method. To learn more, see an example from the view binding GitHub sample.
KOTLIN
JAVA
private ResultProfileBinding binding;

@Override
public View onCreateView (LayoutInflater inflater, 
                          ViewGroup container, 
                          Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    binding = ResultProfileBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false);
    View view = binding.getRoot();
    return view;
}

@Override
public void onDestroyView() {
    super.onDestroyView();
    binding = null;
}

You can now use the instance of the binding class to reference any of the views:

KOTLIN
JAVA
binding.getName().setText(viewModel.getName());
binding.button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    viewModel.userClicked()
});

Note: Fragments outlive their views. Make sure you clean up any references 
If view binding is enabled for a module, a binding class is generated for each XML layout file that the module contains. Each binding class contains references to the root view and all views that have an ID. The name of the binding class is generated by converting the name of the XML file to camel case and adding the word "Binding" to the end.

For example, given a layout file called result_profile.xml:

<LinearLayout ... >
    <TextView android:id="@+id/name" />
    <ImageView android:cropToPadding="true" />
    <Button android:id="@+id/button"
        android:background="@drawable/rounded_button" />
</LinearLayout>

The generated binding class is called ResultProfileBinding. This class has two fields: a TextView called name and a Button called button. The ImageView in the layout has no ID, so there is no reference to it in the binding class.

Every binding class also includes a getRoot() method, providing a direct reference for the root view of the corresponding layout file. In this example, the getRoot() method in the ResultProfileBinding class returns the LinearLayout root view.

The name of the binding class is generated by converting the name of the XML file to camel case and adding the word "Binding" to the end.

For example, given a layout file called result_profile.xml:

<LinearLayout ... >
    <TextView android:id="@+id/name" />
    <ImageView android:cropToPadding="true" />
    <Button android:id="@+id/button"
        android:background="@drawable/rounded_button" />
</LinearLayout>

The generated binding class is called ResultProfileBinding. This class has two fields: a TextView called name and a Button called button. The ImageView in the layout has no ID, so there is no reference to it in the binding class.

Every binding class also includes a getRoot() method, providing a direct reference for the root view of the corresponding layout file. In this example, the getRoot() method in the ResultProfileBinding class returns the LinearLayout root view.

The following sections demonstrate the use of generated binding classes in activities and fragments.

Use view binding in activities
To set up an instance of the binding class for use with an activity, perform the following steps in the activity's onCreate() method:

Call the static inflate() method included in the generated binding class. This creates an instance of the binding class for the activity to use.
Get a reference to the root view by either calling the getRoot() method or using Kotlin property syntax.
Pass the root view to setContentView() to make it the active view on the screen.
KOTLIN
JAVA
private ResultProfileBinding binding;

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    binding = ResultProfileBinding.inflate(getLayoutInflater());
    View view = binding.getRoot();
    setContentView(view);
}

You can now use the instance of the binding class to reference any of the views:

KOTLIN
JAVA
binding.getName().setText(viewModel.getName());
binding.button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    viewModel.userClicked()
});

Use view binding in fragments
To set up an instance of the binding class for use with a fragment, perform the following steps in the fragment's onCreateView() method:

Call the static inflate() method included in the generated binding class. This creates an instance of the binding class for the fragment to use.
Get a reference to the root view by either calling the getRoot() method or using Kotlin property syntax.
Return the root view from the onCreateView() method to make it the active view on the screen.
Note: The inflate() method requires you to pass in a layout inflater. If the layout has already been inflated, you can instead call the binding class's static bind() method. To learn more, see an example from the view binding GitHub sample.
KOTLIN
JAVA
private ResultProfileBinding binding;

@Override
public View onCreateView (LayoutInflater inflater, 
                          ViewGroup container,

    binding = ResultProfileBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false);
    View view = binding.getRoot();
    return view;
}

@Override
public void onDestroyView() {
    super.onDestroyView();
    binding = null;

You can now use the instance of the binding class to reference any of the views:

Use view binding in fragments
To set up an instance of the binding class for use with a fragment, perform the following steps in the fragment's onCreateView() method:

Call the static inflate() method included in the generated binding class. This creates an instance of the binding class for the fragment to use.
Get a reference to the root view by either calling the getRoot() method or using Kotlin property syntax.
Return the root view from the onCreateView() method to make it the active view on the screen.
Note: The inflate() method requires you to pass in a layout inflater. If the layout has already been inflated, you can instead call the binding class's static bind() method. To learn more, see an example from the view binding GitHub sample.
KOTLIN
JAVA
private ResultProfileBinding binding;

@Override
public View onCreateView (LayoutInflater inflater, 
                          ViewGroup container, 
                          Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    binding = ResultProfileBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false);
    View view = binding.getRoot();
    return view;
}

@Override
public void onDestroyView() {
    super.onDestroyView();
    binding = null;
}

You can now use the instance of the binding class to reference any of the views:

KOTLIN
JAVA
binding.getName().setText(viewModel.getName());
binding.button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    viewModel.userClicked()
});

Note: Fragments outlive their views. Make sure you clean up any references 
If view binding is enabled for a module, a binding class is generated for each XML layout file that the module contains. Each binding class contains references to the root view and all views that have an ID. The name of the binding class is generated by converting the name of the XML file to camel case and adding the word "Binding" to the end.

For example, given a layout file called result_profile.xml:

<LinearLayout ... >
    <TextView android:id="@+id/name" />
    <ImageView android:cropToPadding="true" />
    <Button android:id="@+id/button"
        android:background="@drawable/rounded_button" />
</LinearLayout>

The generated binding class is called ResultProfileBinding. This class has two fields: a TextView called name and a Button called button. The ImageView in the layout has no ID, so there is no reference to it in the binding class.

Every binding class also includes a getRoot() method, providing a direct reference for the root view of the corresponding layout file. In this example, the getRoot() method in the ResultProfileBinding class returns the LinearLayout root view.

The name of the binding class is generated by converting the name of the XML file to camel case and adding the word "Binding" to the end.

For example, given a layout file called result_profile.xml:

<LinearLayout ... >
    <TextView android:id="@+id/name" />
    <ImageView android:cropToPadding="true" />
    <Button android:id="@+id/button"
        android:background="@drawable/rounded_button" />
</LinearLayout>

The generated binding class is called ResultProfileBinding. This class has two fields: a TextView called name and a Button called button. The ImageView in the layout has no ID, so there is no reference to it in the binding class.

Every binding class also includes a getRoot() method, providing a direct reference for the root view of the corresponding layout file. In this example, the getRoot() method in the ResultProfileBinding class returns the LinearLayout root view.

The following sections demonstrate the use of generated binding classes in activities and fragments.

Use view binding in activities
To set up an instance of the binding class for use with an activity, perform the following steps in the activity's onCreate() method:

Call the static inflate() method included in the generated binding class. This creates an instance of the binding class for the activity to use.
Get a reference to the root view by either calling the getRoot() method or using Kotlin property syntax.
Pass the root view to setContentView() to make it the active view on the screen.
KOTLIN
JAVA
private ResultProfileBinding binding;

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    binding = ResultProfileBinding.inflate(getLayoutInflater());
    View view = binding.getRoot();
    setContentView(view);
}

You can now use the instance of the binding class to reference any of the views:

KOTLIN
JAVA
binding.getName().setText(viewModel.getName());
binding.button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    viewModel.userClicked()
});

Use view binding in fragments
To set up an instance of the binding class for use with a fragment, perform the following steps in the fragment's onCreateView() method:

Call the static inflate() method included in the generated binding class. This creates an instance of the binding class for the fragment to use.
Get a reference to the root view by either calling the getRoot() method or using Kotlin property syntax.
Return the root view from the onCreateView() method to make it the active view on the screen.
Note: The inflate() method requires you to pass in a layout inflater. If the layout has already been inflated, you can instead call the binding class's static bind() method. To learn more, see an example from the view binding GitHub sample.
KOTLIN
JAVA
private ResultProfileBinding binding;

@Override
public View onCreateView (LayoutInflater inflater, 
                          ViewGroup container,

    binding = ResultProfileBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false);
    View view = binding.getRoot();
    return view;
}

@Override
public void onDestroyView() {
    super.onDestroyView();
    binding = null;

You can now use the instance of the binding class to reference any of the views:

Use view binding in fragments
To set up an instance of the binding class for use with a fragment, perform the following steps in the fragment's onCreateView() method:

Call the static inflate() method included in the generated binding class. This creates an instance of the binding class for the fragment to use.
Get a reference to the root view by either calling the getRoot() method or using Kotlin property syntax.
Return the root view from the onCreateView() method to make it the active view on the screen.
Note: The inflate() method requires you to pass in a layout inflater. If the layout has already been inflated, you can instead call the binding class's static bind() method. To learn more, see an example from the view binding GitHub sample.
KOTLIN
JAVA
private ResultProfileBinding binding;

@Override
public View onCreateView (LayoutInflater inflater, 
                          ViewGroup container, 
                          Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    binding = ResultProfileBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false);
    View view = binding.getRoot();
    return view;
}

@Override
public void onDestroyView() {
    super.onDestroyView();
    binding = null;
}

You can now use the instance of the binding class to reference any of the views:

KOTLIN
JAVA
binding.getName().setText(viewModel.getName());
binding.button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    viewModel.userClicked()
});

Note: Fragments outlive their views. Make sure you clean up any references 
If view binding is enabled for a module, a binding class is generated for each XML layout file that the module contains. Each binding class contains references to the root view and all views that have an ID. The name of the binding class is generated by converting the name of the XML file to camel case and adding the word "Binding" to the end.

For example, given a layout file called result_profile.xml:

<LinearLayout ... >
    <TextView android:id="@+id/name" />
    <ImageView android:cropToPadding="true" />
    <Button android:id="@+id/button"
        android:background="@drawable/rounded_button" />
</LinearLayout>

The generated binding class is called ResultProfileBinding. This class has two fields: a TextView called name and a Button called button. The ImageView in the layout has no ID, so there is no reference to it in the binding class.

Every binding class also includes a getRoot() method, providing a direct reference for the root view of the corresponding layout file. In this example, the getRoot() method in the ResultProfileBinding class returns the LinearLayout root view.

The name of the binding class is generated by converting the name of the XML file to camel case and adding the word "Binding" to the end.

For example, given a layout file called result_profile.xml:

<LinearLayout ... >
    <TextView android:id="@+id/name" />
    <ImageView android:cropToPadding="true" />
    <Button android:id="@+id/button"
        android:background="@drawable/rounded_button" />
</LinearLayout>

The generated binding class is called ResultProfileBinding. This class has two fields: a TextView called name and a Button called button. The ImageView in the layout has no ID, so there is no reference to it in the binding class.

Every binding class also includes a getRoot() method, providing a direct reference for the root view of the corresponding layout file. In this example, the getRoot() method in the ResultProfileBinding class returns the LinearLayout root view.

The following sections demonstrate the use of generated binding classes in activities and fragments.

Use view binding in activities
To set up an instance of the binding class for use with an activity, perform the following steps in the activity's onCreate() method:

Call the static inflate() method included in the generated binding class. This creates an instance of the binding class for the activity to use.
Get a reference to the root view by either calling the getRoot() method or using Kotlin property syntax.
Pass the root view to setContentView() to make it the active view on the screen.
KOTLIN
JAVA
private ResultProfileBinding binding;

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    binding = ResultProfileBinding.inflate(getLayoutInflater());
    View view = binding.getRoot();
    setContentView(view);
}

You can now use the instance of the binding class to reference any of the views:

KOTLIN
JAVA
binding.getName().setText(viewModel.getName());
binding.button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    viewModel.userClicked()
});

Use view binding in fragments
To set up an instance of the binding class for use with a fragment, perform the following steps in the fragment's onCreateView() method:

Call the static inflate() method included in the generated binding class. This creates an instance of the binding class for the fragment to use.
Get a reference to the root view by either calling the getRoot() method or using Kotlin property syntax.
Return the root view from the onCreateView() method to make it the active view on the screen.
Note: The inflate() method requires you to pass in a layout inflater. If the layout has already been inflated, you can instead call the binding class's static bind() method. To learn more, see an example from the view binding GitHub sample.
KOTLIN
JAVA
private ResultProfileBinding binding;

@Override
public View onCreateView (LayoutInflater inflater, 
                          ViewGroup container,

    binding = ResultProfileBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false);
    View view = binding.getRoot();
    return view;
}

@Override
public void onDestroyView() {
    super.onDestroyView();
    binding = null;

You can now use the instance of the binding class to reference any of the views:

Use view binding in fragments
To set up an instance of the binding class for use with a fragment, perform the following steps in the fragment's onCreateView() method:

Call the static inflate() method included in the generated binding class. This creates an instance of the binding class for the fragment to use.
Get a reference to the root view by either calling the getRoot() method or using Kotlin property syntax.
Return the root view from the onCreateView() method to make it the active view on the screen.
Note: The inflate() method requires you to pass in a layout inflater. If the layout has already been inflated, you can instead call the binding class's static bind() method. To learn more, see an example from the view binding GitHub sample.
KOTLIN
JAVA
private ResultProfileBinding binding;

@Override
public View onCreateView (LayoutInflater inflater, 
                          ViewGroup container, 
                          Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    binding = ResultProfileBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false);
    View view = binding.getRoot();
    return view;
}

@Override
public void onDestroyView() {
    super.onDestroyView();
    binding = null;
}

You can now use the instance of the binding class to reference any of the views:

KOTLIN
JAVA
binding.getName().setText(viewModel.getName());
binding.button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    viewModel.userClicked()
});

Note: Fragments outlive their views. Make sure you clean up any references 
If view binding is enabled for a module, a binding class is generated for each XML layout file that the module contains. Each binding class contains references to the root view and all views that have an ID. The name of the binding class is generated by converting the name of the XML file to camel case and adding the word "Binding" to the end.

For example, given a layout file called result_profile.xml:

<LinearLayout ... >
    <TextView android:id="@+id/name" />
    <ImageView android:cropToPadding="true" />
    <Button android:id="@+id/button"
        android:background="@drawable/rounded_button" />
</LinearLayout>

The generated binding class is called ResultProfileBinding. This class has two fields: a TextView called name and a Button called button. The ImageView in the layout has no ID, so there is no reference to it in the binding class.

Every binding class also includes a getRoot() method, providing a direct reference for the root view of the corresponding layout file. In this example, the getRoot() method in the ResultProfileBinding class returns the LinearLayout root view.

The following sections demonstrate the use of generated binding classes in activities and fragments.
